Two-wheeler life cycle assessment
=================================

``carculator_two_wheeler`` estimates the energy use, emissions, costs and life cycle
impacts of bicycles, kick-scooters, mopeds and motorcycles. You choose the vehicle type, size, year, load and
operating conditions. The model calculates the vehicle's mass and energy demand,
then combines them with production, energy-supply and end-of-life inventories.

The results describe a vehicle under the assumptions you supply. A size class
represents a generic vehicle; it is not a digital copy of a particular make or
model. Future inputs and energy scenarios are assumptions about possible futures,
not predictions guaranteed to occur.

1. :doc:`installation` explains the Python environment and package versions.
2. :doc:`usage` walks through a complete calculation with 2025 inputs.
3. :doc:`interpretation` explains units, abbreviations and how to read results.
4. :doc:`validation_examples` shows comparisons with evidence and explains what
   each comparison can establish.

For equations and sources, see :doc:`modeling`. For the detailed checks and
remaining limitations, see :doc:`validity`. Older figures and parameter tables
in the methodology chapter describe their original studies; they are labelled
as historical where they do not describe current defaults.

Shared physics, electricity and fuel assumptions, impact coefficients and export
writers come from ``carculator_utils``. Core calculations use bundled data and
do not need an installed ecoinvent database or Brightway project. Exporting to
another LCA tool requires compatible background data there; see
:doc:`inventory_export`.
