Usage
=====

Use the vehicle package’s input, model and inventory classes. Start with a small
static scope before expanding years, sizes or uncertainty samples.

Quick start
-----------

.. code-block:: python

   from carculator_two_wheeler import (
       TwoWheelerInputParameters,
       TwoWheelerModel,
       InventoryTwoWheeler,
       fill_xarray_from_input_parameters,
   )

   inputs = TwoWheelerInputParameters()
   inputs.static()
   _, array = fill_xarray_from_input_parameters(
       inputs,
       scope={
           "size": ["Motorcycle 11-35kW"],
           "powertrain": ["ICEV-p", "BEV"],
           "year": [2025],
       },
   )
   model = TwoWheelerModel(array)
   model.set_all()
   print(model["TtW energy"])  # kJ per vehicle-kilometre

   inventory = InventoryTwoWheeler(model, functional_unit="vkm")
   impacts = inventory.calculate_impacts()
   print(impacts.sel(impact_category="climate change").sum("impact"))


Inputs and scope
----------------

The vehicle input classes provide packaged defaults. Call ``static()`` for a
single deterministic sample, or ``stochastic(n, seed=42)`` for seeded parameter
draws. The array builder returns ``(mappings, array)`` and preserves labelled
``size``, ``powertrain``, ``parameter``, ``year`` and ``value`` dimensions.
Scope by actual labels and native input years; interpolate explicitly when a
year is not in the parameter table. The current defaults include 2025.

Change input parameters before constructing a fresh vehicle model. Constructor
overrides such as battery chemistry, capacity, fuel blends and component
efficiencies are copied, preserving the caller's data. Most vehicle overrides
use ``(powertrain, size, year)`` keys; consult the model API for exceptions.
Repeated ``set_all()`` calls on an already completed model are not the supported
way to compare independent scenarios.

See :doc:`bev_sizing` for range-, capacity- and mass-driven battery scenarios,
override precedence and chemistry-dependent energy demand.

Energy and results
------------------

``model["TtW energy"]`` is kJ per vehicle-kilometre. For BEVs it is net
stored-energy depletion; ``model.battery_terminal_energy`` is a separate DC
boundary, and ``model["electricity consumption"]`` is grid electricity in
kWh/km. Multiply the latter by 100 for kWh/100 km.

Construct the inventory with the completed model, not its raw parameter array.
Use ``calculate_impacts()`` and labelled selection/reduction of the returned
xarray. Functional units are ``vkm``, ``pkm`` and ``tkm``. Passenger- and
cargo-normalized results require finite positive loads for active vehicles.
Availability-masked zero consumption does not describe a zero-energy vehicle.


Inventory export
----------------

Install the optional export dependencies described in :doc:`installation`.
After a complete model and inventory calculation, the shared public API is:

.. code-block:: python

   paths = inventory.export_lci(
       ecoinvent_version="3.10",
       software="brightway2",
       format="file",
       directory="exports",
       filename="vehicle-comparison",
   )

``software`` accepts ``brightway2`` or ``simapro``. Brightway export supports
``file``, ``string`` and ``bw2io``; SimaPro supports ``file`` and ``string``.
The supported ecoinvent targets are 3.9 and 3.10. Multi-year runs preserve every
year in the returned exports, and exporting does not change the original
inventory or calculated impacts. A destination Brightway/ecoinvent setup is
needed to register and link exported inventories, not for the core calculation.

Reproducibility and interpretation
----------------------------------

Record package versions, input overrides, driving cycle, load, geography,
fuel blend, background scenario, functional unit and energy meter boundary.
Seeded parameter draws do not seed every downstream cost adjustment.
See :doc:`validity` for the scope of
calibration, measurement comparisons and known limitations.


Battery unit costs
------------------

Explicit battery unit prices survive chemistry selection and automatic cost
adjustment. Using the input array from the quick start above:

.. code-block:: python

   model = TwoWheelerModel(
       array,
       battery_costs={
           "energy battery cost per kWh": {("BEV", "Motorcycle 11-35kW", 2025): 100},
       },
   )
   model.set_all()

The amount is EUR/kWh of nominal capacity before markup; use
``power battery cost per kW`` for power batteries (EUR/kW). Amounts must be finite
and nonnegative, either scalar or one per sample in the array's sample order.
Zero and prices equal to packaged inputs are supported.

Ordinary battery-cost array edits and changed dictionary/file definitions also
survive, provided the array retains the reference coordinates supplied by the
current array builder. Use the constructor for old or hand-built arrays, or for
an explicit price equal to the original input. An explicit generic price wins
over an explicit price for the selected chemistry; untouched inputs keep the
existing year trajectory. Prices affect purchase and replacement costs without
changing mass, energy use or environmental inventories.

See the shared `battery-cost guide
<https://github.com/Laboratory-for-Energy-Systems-Analysis/carculator_utils/blob/master/docs/battery_costs.rst>`_
for chemistry selection, sensitivity, provenance and plug-in-hybrid component
inputs. This change preserves supplied prices; it does not recalibrate the
underlying default cost curve.


Multi-year cost calculations
----------------------------

Automatic component-cost projections now align year and sample labels explicitly.
This corrects a reshaping error that mixed prices between years and samples in
multi-year uncertainty and sensitivity runs. The sensitivity reference now agrees
with static costs in each year; the default BEV battery prices are EUR 186.49,
134.64 and 102.57/kWh in 2020, 2025 and 2030, respectively.

The equations, uncertainty distributions and explicit battery-price precedence
are unchanged. Static calculations and single-year sampled calculations retain
their previous results. Regenerate multi-year uncertainty and sensitivity costs
calculated with the old projection. Each sample's cost factor applies across all
years in that run; input seeding still does not seed the separate global cost RNG.

Completed regressions compare sensitivity references with static results across
battery-electric and combustion powertrains. Paired runs with the pre-fix cost
hooks also verify unchanged physical outputs, inventories and LCIA. These checks
validate the numerical assignment of costs, not the empirical price assumptions.
