Usage
=====

Use the vehicle package’s input, model and inventory classes. Start with a small
static scope before expanding years, sizes or uncertainty samples.

Quick start
-----------

.. code-block:: python

   from carculator_two_wheeler import (
       TwoWheelerInputParameters,
       TwoWheelerModel,
       InventoryTwoWheeler,
       fill_xarray_from_input_parameters,
   )

   inputs = TwoWheelerInputParameters()
   inputs.static()
   _, array = fill_xarray_from_input_parameters(
       inputs,
       scope={
           "size": ["Motorcycle 11-35kW"],
           "powertrain": ["ICEV-p", "BEV"],
           "year": [2025],
       },
   )
   model = TwoWheelerModel(array)
   model.set_all()
   print(model["TtW energy"])  # kJ per vehicle-kilometre

   inventory = InventoryTwoWheeler(model, functional_unit="vkm")
   impacts = inventory.calculate_impacts()
   print(impacts.sel(impact_category="climate change").sum("impact"))


Inputs and scope
----------------

The vehicle input classes provide packaged defaults. Call ``static()`` for a
single deterministic sample, or ``stochastic(n, seed=42)`` for seeded parameter
draws. The array builder returns ``(mappings, array)`` and preserves labelled
``size``, ``powertrain``, ``parameter``, ``year`` and ``value`` dimensions.
Scope by actual labels and native input years; interpolate explicitly when a
year is not in the parameter table. The current defaults include 2025.

Change input parameters before constructing a fresh vehicle model. Constructor
overrides such as battery chemistry, capacity, fuel blends and component
efficiencies are copied, preserving the caller's data. Most vehicle overrides
use ``(powertrain, size, year)`` keys; consult the model API for exceptions.
Repeated ``set_all()`` calls on an already completed model are not the supported
way to compare independent scenarios.

See :doc:`bev_sizing` for range-, capacity- and mass-driven battery scenarios,
override precedence and chemistry-dependent energy demand.

Energy and results
------------------

``model["TtW energy"]`` is kJ per vehicle-kilometre. For BEVs it is net
stored-energy depletion; ``model.battery_terminal_energy`` is a separate DC
boundary, and ``model["electricity consumption"]`` is grid electricity in
kWh/km. Multiply the latter by 100 for kWh/100 km.

Construct the inventory with the completed model, not its raw parameter array.
Use ``calculate_impacts()`` and labelled selection/reduction of the returned
xarray. Functional units are ``vkm``, ``pkm`` and ``tkm``. Passenger- and
cargo-normalized results require finite positive loads for active vehicles.
Availability-masked zero consumption does not describe a zero-energy vehicle.


Inventory export
----------------

The shared runtime includes Brightpath and its export writers. Continue with
the completed inventory from the quick start:

.. code-block:: python

   workbook = inventory.export_lci(
       ecoinvent_version="3.10",
       software="brightway2", format="file", directory="exports",
   )
   simapro_csv = inventory.export_lci(
       software="simapro", format="file", directory="exports",
   )
   foreground_zip = inventory.export_lci(
       software="openlca", format="file", directory="exports",
   )

Export requires exactly one retained sample, selected before constructing the
model and inventory. The static quick start already has one sample. Every
selected year gets an export; multiple years return a list. The original
inventory, calculated impacts and functional unit remain unchanged.

The default ``export_lci()`` returns an unlinked Brightway ``LCIImporter``.
Supported ecoinvent targets are exactly ``3.9`` and ``3.10``, cut-off. The
openLCA ZIP contains foreground processes without an ecoinvent background or
LCIA methods; map external providers and elementary flows before calculation.
SimaPro uses Latin-1 CSV and warns when custom noise flows are omitted.
See :doc:`inventory_export` for the full format/return-value table, sample
selection and linking requirements.

Reproducibility and interpretation
----------------------------------

Record package versions, input overrides, driving cycle, load, geography,
fuel blend, background scenario, functional unit and energy meter boundary.
``stochastic(n, seed=42)`` also seeds projected-cost factors. Keep the array's
auxiliary coordinates and build fresh models for independent runs. See the
`shared cost-uncertainty guide
<https://github.com/Laboratory-for-Energy-Systems-Analysis/carculator_utils/blob/master/docs/cost_uncertainty.rst>`_
for sample selection, serialization and legacy-array behavior.
See :doc:`validity` for the scope of
calibration, measurement comparisons and known limitations.


Battery unit costs
------------------

Explicit battery unit prices survive chemistry selection and automatic cost
adjustment. Using the input array from the quick start above:

.. code-block:: python

   model = TwoWheelerModel(
       array,
       battery_costs={
           "energy battery cost per kWh": {("BEV", "Motorcycle 11-35kW", 2025): 100},
       },
   )
   model.set_all()

The amount is EUR/kWh of nominal capacity before markup; use
``power battery cost per kW`` for power batteries (EUR/kW). Amounts must be finite
and nonnegative, either scalar or one per sample in the array's sample order.
Zero and prices equal to packaged inputs are supported.

Ordinary battery-cost array edits and changed dictionary/file definitions also
survive, provided the array retains the reference coordinates supplied by the
current array builder. Use the constructor for old or hand-built arrays, or for
an explicit price equal to the original input. An explicit generic price wins
over an explicit price for the selected chemistry; untouched inputs keep the
existing year trajectory. Prices affect purchase and replacement costs without
changing mass, energy use or environmental inventories.

See the shared `battery-cost guide
<https://github.com/Laboratory-for-Energy-Systems-Analysis/carculator_utils/blob/master/docs/battery_costs.rst>`_
for chemistry selection, sensitivity, provenance and plug-in-hybrid component
inputs. This change preserves supplied prices; it does not recalibrate the
underlying default cost curve.


Multi-year cost calculations
----------------------------

Automatic component-cost projections now align year and sample labels explicitly.
This corrects a reshaping error that mixed prices between years and samples in
multi-year uncertainty and sensitivity runs. The sensitivity reference now agrees
with static costs in each year; the default BEV battery prices are EUR 186.49,
134.64 and 102.57/kWh in 2020, 2025 and 2030, respectively.

The equations, uncertainty distributions and explicit battery-price precedence
are unchanged. Static calculations retain their previous results. Regenerate
multi-year sensitivity costs calculated with the old projection, and stochastic
costs calculated before cost factors were tied to the input seed. Each sample's
factor applies across all years and survives reordering or selection, including
selection of just one sample. ``stochastic(1)`` now also draws a cost factor;
use ``static()`` for deterministic inputs and prices.

Completed regressions compare sensitivity references with static results across
battery-electric and combustion powertrains. Paired runs with the pre-fix cost
hooks also verify unchanged physical outputs, inventories and LCIA. These checks
validate the numerical assignment of costs, not the empirical price assumptions.
