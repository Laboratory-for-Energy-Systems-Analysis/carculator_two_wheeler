It has been suggested that due to their increased weight, non-exhaust emissions of particles from BEV may exceed all particle emissions, including exhaust, from an ICEV. This paper examines the vehicle weight-dependence of PM10 and PM2.5 emissions from abrasion (brake, tyre and road surface wear) and road dust resuspension and generates a comparison of the two vehicle types. The outcome is critically dependent upon the extent of regenerative braking relative to use of friction brakes on the BEV, but overall there will be only modest changes to the total local emissions of particles from a passenger car built to current emissions standards.},

	abstract = {Fuel cell electric vehicles promise to be a viable technical option for using surplus energy produced by renewables, and in turn, help the transport sector to reduce environmental impacts. However, the technology is still under development and, for some components, the environmental performance is uncertain, e.g. the hydrogen storage tank. Manufacturers produce hydrogen tanks consisting of carbon composite materials because of their mechanical properties. Yet, the production of carbon fibers involves complex and energy-intensive processes. Therefore, this study addresses a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of a fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) and focuses on the manufacturing process of the hydrogen storage tank and carbon fibers needed for its production. This study suggests that the tank is important for climate change, ionizing radiation and fossil depletion, but less relevant for toxic-related environmental indicators. The evaluation of the future scenario suggested an improvement in the environmental performance of the tank, especially regarding climate change by 46%, namely 5.6 t CO2-Eq versus 3.0 t CO2-Eq, and human toxicity by 75%, namely 2.7 t 1, 4-DCB-Eq versus 0.7 t 1, 4-DCB-Eq per tank for current and future conditions, respectively. Finally, for a lifetime mileage of 150,000 km, the fuel cell electric vehicle is responsible for 15 kg CO2-Eq/100 km in the current scenario and 9 kg CO2-Eq/100 km in the future scenario, respectively.},

This work compares the environmental life-cycle performance of three different passenger cars fuelled by hydrogen: a fuel cell electric vehicle, an internal combustion engine car, and a hybrid electric vehicle. Besides, two vehicles that use hydrogen in a mixture with natural gas or gasoline were considered. In all cases, hydrogen produced by wind power electrolysis was assumed. The resultant life-cycle profiles were benchmarked against those of a compressed natural gas car and a hybrid electric vehicle fed with natural gas. Vehicle infrastructure was identified as the main source of environmental burdens. Nevertheless, the three pure hydrogen vehicles were all found to be excellent decarbonisation solutions, whereas vehicles that use hydrogen mixed with natural gas or gasoline represent good opportunities to encourage the use of hydrogen in the short term while reducing emissions compared to ordinary vehicles.},

We consider conventional gasoline (ICEV), battery electric (BEV) and fuel cell electric (FCEV) motorcycles with production years from 1990 to 2030. Motorcycle energy consumption is modelled based on the world harmonized motorcycle test cycle and calibrated with data measured from existing motorcycles. We model the potential future performance of motorcycles by adapting the model input parameters according to historic trends and future component performance predictions. We find that smaller motorcycles have much better environmental performance than larger motorcycles, though this is mostly due to the fact that larger motorcycles have different driving patterns: urban driving is found to have much lower environmental impact per kilometer than highway driving. Current BEV are found to have similar ownership costs to ICEV. They also have reduced climate change potential by roughly 60% when they are powered by electricity from natural gas, 80% when powered by renewables, and they still offer advantages over conventional motorcycles when charged with electricity from hard coal. Next generation BEV are found to have similar environmental performance advantages, though with a definite cost advantage. FCEV climate change reduction potential is found to depend strongly on the source of the hydrogen fuel, with climate benefits being substantial with hydrogen originating from renewable energy sources. Future cost competitiveness of FCEVs is linked closely to the development of fuel cell costs.},

The study combines the results of the large transport simulation model MATSim applied to Switzerland, with a noise characterization model, N-LCA, developed in the context of life cycle assessment. MATSim results allow tracking the use of private and public transportation by agents in the model. The results after characterization provide a consumption-based noise footprint, thus the total noise and impacts that are caused by the private mobility demand of the citizens of Switzerland. Our results confirm that road transportation is the largest contributor to the total noise footprint of land-based mobility. We also included a scenario with a full transition to an electrified car fleet, which showed the potential for the reduction of impacts, particularly in urban areas, by about 55% as compared to the modeled regime with combustion engines.},

The results show that active cathode material, aluminum, and energy use for cell production are the major contributors to the energy and environmental impacts of NMC batteries. However, this study also notes that the impacts could change significantly, depending on where in the world the battery is produced, and where the materials are sourced. In an effort to harmonize existing LCAs of automotive LIBs and guide future research, this study also lays out differences in life cycle inventories (LCIs) for key battery materials among existing LIB LCA studies, and identifies knowledge gaps.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Due to the large environmental challenges posed by the transport sector, reliable and state-of-the art data for its life cycle assessment is essential for enabling a successful transition towards more sustainable systems. In this paper, the new electric passenger car transport and vehicle datasets, which have been developed for ecoinvent version 3, are presented. Methods: The new datasets have been developed with a strong modular approach, defining a hierarchy of datasets corresponding to various technical components in the vehicle. A vehicle is therefore modelled by linking together the various component datasets. Also, parameters and mathematical formulas have been introduced in order to define the amount of exchanges in the datasets through common transport and vehicle characteristics. This supports users in the choice of the amount of exchanges and enhances the transparency of the dataset. Results: The new transport dataset describes the transport over 1km with a battery electric passenger car taking into account the vehicle production and end of life, the energy consumption due to the use phase, non-exhaust emissions, maintenance and road infrastructure. The dataset has been developed and is suitable for a compact class vehicle. Conclusions: A new electric passenger car transport dataset has been developed for version 3 of the ecoinvent database which exploits modularisation and parameters with the aim of facilitating users in adapting the data to their specific needs. Apart from the direct use of the transport dataset for background data, the various datasets for the different components can also be used as building blocks for virtual vehicles.},

	abstract = {Many public transport authorities have a great interest in introducing zero-emission electric buses. However, the transformation process from diesel to electric bus systems opens up a vast design space which seems prohibitive for a systematic decision making process. We present a holistic design methodology to identify the 'most suitable system solution' under given strategic and operational requirements. The relevant vehicle technologies and charging systems are analysed and structured using a morphological matrix. A modular simulation model is introduced which takes technical and operational aspects into account. The model can be used to determine a feasible electric bus system. The technology selection is based on a detailed economic analysis which is conducted by means of a total cost of ownership (TCO) model. To cope with uncertainties in forecasting, a stochastic modelling of critical input parameters is applied and three different future scenarios are evaluated. The applicability of the model was verified in a pilot project in Berlin and the methodology was applied to a realistic operational scenario. Our results indicate that electric bus systems are technically feasible and can become economically competitive from the year 2025 under the conditions examined.},

   abstract = {Within the context of carbon dioxide (CO2) utilization there is an increasing interest in using CO2 as a resource to produce sustainable liquid hydrocarbon fuels. When these fuels are produced by solely using solar energy they are labeled as solar fuels. In the recent discourse on solar fuels intuitive arguments are used to support the prospects of these fuels. This paper takes a quantitative approach to investigate some of the claims made in this discussion. We analyze the life cycle performance of various classes of solar fuel processes using different primary energy and CO 2 sources. We compare their efficacy with respect to carbon mitigation with ubiquitous fossil-based fuels and conclude that producing liquid hydrocarbon fuels starting from CO2 by using existing technologies requires much more energy than existing fuels. An improvement in life cycle CO2 emissions is only found when solar energy and atmospheric CO 2 are used. Producing fuels from CO2 is a very long-term niche at best, not the panacea suggested in the recent public discourse. Â© 2014 American Chemical Society.},

Technology and societal needs continue to drive change. Digitalisation, automation and alternative energy sources are challenging traditional features and creating new opportunities linked with resource efficiency and the collaborative and circular economy. However, such changes can also be disruptive. While they create new jobs, they can also make others obsolete. They call for new skills, good working conditions and need anticipation, adaptation and investment. Transport needs to develop along a more sustainable path. With the COP21 Paris Climate agreement, efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are becoming even more urgent. An energy-efficient, de-carbonised transport sector is needed. An ambitious climate policy is integral part of Energy Union with a target of at least 27 percent share of renewable energy consumed in the EU in 2030. Decarbonisation requires the development of technologies. The Commission is pushing forward the electrification of all modes of transport â road, rail, air and sea â using clean, renewable energy sourc-es. Electrification of transport is one of the key technologies that will support progress towards im-proved energy efficiency, greater use of renewable energy and lower CO 2 emissions targets.},

Three fuel blends (B10, B20 and B30) with good properties were selected to evaluate the engine's performance and emissions on an unmodified diesel engine test bench. The results show that the engine's power was decreased when adding biodiesel. Brake specific fuel consumption was higher with the fuel blends than with diesel, apart from B10, which showed lower brake specific energy consumption. Compared to diesel, hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, as well as smoke opacity, reduced significantly with the fuel blends whilst mono-nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions increased. Biodiesel from cooking oil is a good fuel additive for diesel, but should not to be used at a high content because of its increased 50% distillation temperature, density, kinematic viscosity and copper corrosiveness and decreased LHV. It is beneficial to use blend fuels at the appropriate content because their exhaust emissions have a positive effect on reducing the emissions of HC and CO, as well as smoke opacity.},

	abstract = {Oxymethylene Dimethyl Ethers (OMEs) are promising diesel fuel alternatives and interesting solvents for various industrial applications. In this report, a well-to-wheel life cycle assessment of short OME oligomers as produced via a Power-to-Liquid (PtL) pathway has been conducted. Variations in electricity and carbon dioxide supply as well as the hardware demand for the PtL plant components (e.g. PEM water electrolysis, carbon capturing, and 36 kta OME plant capacity) have been considered. Conventional diesel fuel is used as the comparative benchmark. In scenarios with a high share of renewable electricity well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emission for OME3â5 fuel is advantageous compared to fossil diesel. For the best case, well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced by 86%, corresponding to 29 g(CO2eq) kmâ1 (OME3â5-fuel) compared to 209 g(CO2eq) kmâ1 (diesel fuel). However, these results are highly sensitive to the applied method with regard to system multifunctionality. A sensitivity analysis indicates that input electricity at â¼50 g(CO2eq) kWhelâ1 enables well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions of <100 g(CO2eq) kmâ1. For other environmental impact categories, acidification, eutrophication, respiratory effects, photochemical ozone creation and resource depletion exceed significantly the fossil fuel reference. A high share of these impacts can be assigned to electricity production, either through direct electricity consumption in the PtL system or during upstream production of hardware components. The presented results and discussion demonstrate the necessity for global defossilisation including material efficient manufacturing of renewable energy plants which remains mandatory for synfuel production addressing a wide range of environmental impact categories. Furthermore, PtL production concerning well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions could be beneficial even in Germany if dedicated renewable energy capacities are considered. However, operation of large-scale PtL plants will predominantly be conducted in countries with high renewable energy potential, resulting in low levelized cost of electricity and high full load hours.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Light-duty vehicles contribute considerably to global greenhouse gas emissions. Fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) may play a key role in mitigating these emissions without facing the same limitations in range and refueling time as battery electric vehicles (BEVs). In this study, we assess the environmental impacts and costs of a polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell system (FCS) for use in light-duty FCVs and integrate these results into a comparative evaluation between FCVs, BEVs, and internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). Methods: We conduct a detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) and cost assessment for the current state of the technology and two future scenarios for technological development. We compile a detailed and consistent inventory for the FCS by systematically disassembling and integrating information found in cost studies. For the vehicle-level comparison, we use models to ensure that vehicle size, performance, and fuel consumption are unbiased between vehicle types and consistent with the scenarios for technological development. Results and discussion: Our results show that FCVs can decrease life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 50Â % compared to gasoline ICEVs if hydrogen is produced from renewable electricity, thus exhibiting similar emission levels as BEVs that are charged with the same electricitymix. If hydrogen is produced by natural gas reforming, FCVs are found to offer no greenhouse gas reductions, along with higher impacts in several other environmental impact categories. A major contributor to these impacts is the FCS, in particular the platinum in the catalyst and the carbon fiber in the hydrogen tank. The large amount of carbon fiber used in the tank was also the reason why we found that FCVs may not become fully cost competitive with ICEVs or BEVs, even when substantial technological development and mass production of all components is assumed. Conclusions: We conclude that FCVs only lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions than ICEVs if their fuel is sourced from renewable energy, as is the case with BEVs. FCVs are an attractive alternative to ICEVs in terms of vehicle performance criteria such as range and refueling time. However, the technological challenges associated with reducing other environmental impacts and costs of FCVs seem to be as large, if not larger, than those associated with thecapacity and costs of batteries for BEVsâeven when not taking into account the efforts required to build a hydrogen infrastructure network for road transportation.},

We chose parking lots on expressways, commercial parking lots in cities, municipal facilities, shopping centers, etc. throughout the country as the charging sites according to the EV charge program in Southern California. Air-pollutant emissions during the transportation phase were calculated based on the emission factors of vehicles, running speed and the transport distance between one factory of the charging equipment and each site. The share of transporting the charging machines in total emissions of CO2, SOx and CO was less than 15% and the production phase was dominant. In case of NOx, the share of transporting them was over 20%. The relation between gasoline vehicle and gas station was applied to estimate the number of EVs using the charging stations through the country, and the contribution of the charging stations to life-cycle emissions of air pollutants from EV was presented. The share of infrastructure in total emissions of CO2 was 16% in our model case. Thus the development of the charging infrastructure almost did not change the advantage of EV compared to gasoline vehicle (GV) in terms of CO2, NON, and CO emissions. But an EV emits more life-cycle SOx than gasoline vehicles (GVs). {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The efficiency, feasibility, and benefits of the two schemes are examined. Electric vehicles currently lack widespread popularity mainly due to battery limitations, especially for long distance travel. The rural highway charging methods presented here can greatly increase the range of electric vehicles while decreasing battery sizes. Average modeling approaches for power electronics and vehicle usage were developed in MATLAB/Simulink to compare the two systems, each at two power levels. 30 kW and 48 kW were chosen to demonstrate the differences between power levels both capable of maintaining a positive net charge on a dynamic electric vehicle. Component efficiencies, energy transfer levels, and installation percentages for the various models were determined. The models were applied to California highway I-5 to show immense potential savings over gasoline vehicles. It was shown that catenary charging is cheaper and has higher energy transfer than wireless; however, it has difficulty servicing all vehicle types, has visible wires, and requires more maintenance.},

However, appropriate selection of cells for different applications is difficult due to limited public data comparing the most commonly used off-the-shelf Li-ion chemistries under the same operating conditions. This article details a multi-year cycling study of commercial LiFePO4 (LFP), LiNixCoyAl1âxâyO2 (NCA), and LiNixMnyCo1âxâyO2 (NMC) cells, varying the discharge rate, depth of discharge (DOD), and environment temperature. The capacity and discharge energy retention, as well as the round-trip efficiency, were compared. Even when operated within manufacturer specifications, the range of cycling conditions had a profound effect on cell degradation, with time to reach 80% capacity varying by thousands of hours and cycle counts among cells of each chemistry. The degradation of cells in this study was compared to that of similar cells in previous studies to identify universal trends and to provide a standard deviation for performance. All cycling files have been made publicly available at batteryarchive.org, a recently developed repository for visualization and comparison of battery data, to facilitate future experimental and modeling efforts.},

	abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology is used in this study to assess the environmental impact of five candidate batteries for electric vehicles under different conditions of charging. The entire lifetime of a passenger electric vehicle is considered as the basis for all batteries. Five different battery systems are considered. The four of them are electrically recharged - Lead-Acid, Nickel-Cadmium, Nickel-Metal hydride and Sodium-Nickel chloride â whereas one system comprises batteries that are recharged mechanically (Zinc-Air). One specific battery from these five systems is selected. The results are representative of these particular batteries and not of the battery systems to which they belong. The study includes three scenarios, the basic scenario and two fast charging scenarios. The difference between the scenarios is in the phase of the battery's use and involves the charging regimes. Consequently, the other stages of the battery's life are identical in all three scenarios. The basic scenario implies normal overnight charging is used during the entire lifetime of an electric vehicle. In the first fast charging scenario, fast charging is combined with normal charging. The second fast charging scenario involves the exclusive use of fast charging. In both fast charging scenarios the user's behaviour is considered. In this study, it is believed that it is the violation of fast charging rules, set by the battery manufacturer rather than the fast charging technique, that will be critical for the cycle life of the battery. Due to low energy efficiency of the batteries and losses in the charging procedure, the use of energy for operating the electric vehicle seems to be a major contributor to the total environmental impact of the system. Significant resource constraints may prevent mass production of certain batteries or lead to increased prices of others. Use of fast charging increases the number of batteries used during the lifetime of the electric vehicle. It appears though, that it makes little difference if fast charging is used partially or exclusively. The use of recycled materials will reduce the size of the impact.},

	abstract = {The transport sector is a crucial bottleneck in the decarbonization challenge. To study the sector's decarbonization potential in the wider systems perspective, we couple a large-scale integrated assessment model, Regionalized Model of INvestments and Development (REMIND), to a detailed transport model, Energy Demand Generator-Transport(EDGE-T). This approach allows the analysis of mobility futures in the context of long-term and global energy sector transformations, at a high level of modal and technological granularity and internal consistency. The runtime of the coupled system increases by $\sim$ 15â20% compared with a REMIND standalone application, and first convergence tests are promising. To illustrate the capabilities of our modeling approach, we focus on a reference pathway for Europe. Preliminary results indicate that transport service demands grow in the next decades for both passenger and freight transport. Transport system emissions are expected to decrease in the same time range, due to a shift towards electric drivetrains, advanced vehicles, more efficient modes as well as a slight increase in the share of biofuels.},

By 2040, battery and fuel cell electric trucks appear to be promising options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions per ton-km on long distance segments, even where the required range autonomy is high. This requires that various conditions are met, such as improvements at the energy storage level and a drastic reduction of the greenhouse gas intensity of the electricity used for battery charging and hydrogen production. Meanwhile, these options may be considered for urban and regional applications, where they have a competitive advantage thanks to their superior engine efficiency. Finally, these alternative options will have to compete against more mature combustion-based technologies which, despite lower drivetrain efficiencies, are expected to reduce their exhaust emissions via engine improvements, hybridization of their powertrain, as well as the use of biomass-based and synthetic fuels.},

This study brings about factual data and evidence about causes for coach overweight. A combination of factors leading to potential overweight have been identified, such as the increased empty weight of vehicles, but also the increase in the average weight of passengers and luggage they carry, due to changes in the demographic and travel patterns, as well as safety and environmental standards. In particular, the average passenger weight was found to be 7 kg higher than the one laid down in the concerned European Directive. The lack of harmonisation between Member States regarding vehicle type approval makes the problem worse; the application of environmental and safety related standards and the installation of comfort features make buses and coaches heavier.},

While numerous studies have investigated the potential of electrifying passenger transport, less focus has been on how road freight transport could be powered in a sustainable future. This study looks at Electric Road Systems (ERS) in comparison to the current diesel system. The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development was used to assess whether ERS could be a stepping stone on the way towards sustainability. Strategic life-cycle assessment was applied, scanning each life-cycle phase for violations against basic sustainability principles. Resulting sustainability "hot spots" were quantified with traditional life-cycle assessment. The results show that, if powered by renewable energy, ERS have a potential to decrease the environmental impact of freight transport considerably. Environmental payback times of less than five years are achievable if freight traffic volumes are sufficiently high. However, some severe violations against sustainability principles were identified. Still, ERS could prove to be a valuable part of the solution, as they drastically decrease the need for large batteries with high cost and sustainability impact, thereby catalyzing electrification and the transition towards sustainable freight transport.},

	abstract = {The transportation sector, especially road transport, must reduce its energy consumption and emissions significantly. This requirement also applies to road-bound public transport, which uses mainly diesel buses. A reasonable measure for reaching this goal is to electrify the vehicle's drivetrain. During the past decade, several alternative technologies have evolved, namely, hybrid electric buses, fuel cell electric buses, and battery electric buses (BEBs). For a comparison of their energy efficiency, both the drivetrain's efficiency and the efficiency of the energy supply must be examined to determine well-to-wheel efficiency. This paper attempted to compare seven drivetrains for urban transit buses: diesel, natural gas, diesel-electric, hybrid electric (series and parallel), fuel cell electric, battery electric, and trolley bus. This comparison will become the main part of a more extensive model that supports decision making in bus procurement processes. The model will be as simple as possible. This factor makes it suitable also for the practitioner's use. Therefore, an analytic approach instead of a simulation tool was used. The model's outcomes were both total and specific energy consumption of four generic bus types operating on a dedicated bus line. The result of the study found that the trolley bus, closely followed by the BEB, was the most efficient, even when the share of renewable energy in electricity generation was low. The possibility to reduce specific energy consumption by increasing the occupation rate is outlined as well.},

	abstract = {The production and end-of-life (EoL) processes for current and future proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) systems for road passenger vehicle applications were analysed and quantified in the form of life cycle inventories. The current PEMFC technology is characterised by highly sensitive operating conditions and a high system mass. For each core component of PEMFC there are a range of materials under development and the research aimed to identify those considered realistic for a 2020 future scenario and according to commercial goals of achieving higher performance, increased power density, greater stability and a marked reduction of costs. End-of-life scenarios were developed in consideration of the materials at the focus of recovery efforts. The life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) addressed the production and EoL of the fuel cell systems with inclusion of a sensitivity analysis to assess influences on the results from the key fuel cell parameters. The second part to the LCIA assessed the environmental and human health burdens from passenger transport in a fuel cell vehicle (FCV) with comparison between the 2012 and 2020 fuel cell scenarios and referenced to an internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) of Euro5 emission standard. It was seen that whilst the drivetrain (and therefore the fuel cell system) is a major contributor to the emissions in all the indicators shown, the hydrogen use (and therefore the efficiency of the fuel cell system and the method of hydrogen production) can have a far greater influence on the environmental performance. Overall, the results show inconclusive environmental benefits for using FCV instead of modern ICEV: a substantial reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions can only be achieved using hydrogen produced with non-fossil energy resources. However, even such "clean" hydrogen used in FCV will not lead to a reduction of several other environmental burdens from the life cycle perspective within the time frame considered.},

	abstract = {Natural gas is a transport fuel which may help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in shipping and trucks. However, there is some disagreement regarding the potential for natural gas to provide significant improvements relative to current ships and trucks. In 2015, road freight represented $\sim$7% of global energy related CO2 emissions, with international shipping representing $\sim$2.6% of global emissions. These emissions are also expected to grow, with some estimates suggesting road freight emission growing by a third, and shipping emissions growing by between 50% and 250% from 2012 to 2050, making absolute emissions reductions challenging. In addition, reducing emissions in ships and trucks has proved technically difficult given the relatively long distances that ships and trucks travel. This paper documents a systematic review of literature detailing well-to-wheel/wake greenhouse gas emissions and economic costs in moving from diesel and heavy fuel oil to natural gas as a fuel for trucks and ships. The review found a number of important issues for greenhouse gas reduction. First, moderate greenhouse gas reductions of 10% were found when switching to natural gas from heavy fuel oil in shipping when comparing the lowest estimates. Comparing lowest well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions estimates for trucks, the benefit of switching to natural gas fuel is approximately a 16% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. However, these emissions are highly variable, driven particularly by methane emissions in exhaust gas. Given this, in the worst cases natural gas ships and trucks emit more greenhouse gasses than the diesel trucks and heavy fuel oil ships that they would replace. It appears relatively cost effective to switch to natural gas as a transport fuel in ships and trucks. However, the limited emissions reduction potential raises questions for the ongoing role of natural gas to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the challenging greenhouse gas reduction targets emerging in the transport sector.},

	abstract = {Background, Goal and Scope. The ecoinvent database is a reference work for life cycle inventory data covering the areas of energy, building materials, metals, chemicals, paper and cardboard, forestry, agriculture, detergents, transport services and waste treatment. Generic inventories are available for freight and passenger transport including air, rail, road, and water transport. The goal of freight transport modelling is to provide background data for transport services, which occur between nearly any two process steps of a product system. This paper presents and discusses the model structure, basic assumptions and results for selected freight transport services. Main Features. Transport services are divided into several datasets referred to as transport components. In addition to vehicle operation (comprising vehicle travel and pre-combusrion), infrastructure processes such as vehicle maintenance, manufacturing and disposal, as well as transport infrastructure construction, operation and disposal, are also modelled. In order to link the various transport components to the functional unit of one tonne kilometre (tkm), so-called demand factors are determined. In the case of transport infrastructure that is not exclusively used by freight transport, allocation is essential. The respective allocation parameters employed for line infrastructure construction/disposal and operation datasets (including land use) are yearly Gross-tonne kilometre performance (Gtkm) and kilometric vehicle/train performance. Results are presented for selected environmental exchanges related to gaseous emissions (climate change gases, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons), heavy metal (zinc and cadmium) emissions to soil and air, as well as BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand), and land use. Particle emissions are further distinguished into fine (PM2.5) and coarse (diameter between 2.5 and 10 mum) particles. The results presented comprise both an intra- and intermodal comparison. Results and Discussions. A comparison of Swiss and European rail transport reveals considerably lower emissions from Swiss rail transport due to the almost exclusive use of hydropower as traction energy. For gaseous emissions, freight transport by water or rail exhibits considerably better performance than road transport (65-92% less gaseous emissions). As far as zinc and cadmium emissions to soil are concerned, water and rail transport produce less than 1% of the emissions resulting from road transport for either pollutant. For zinc and cadmium emissions to air, road transport has the highest emissions; however, the emissions due to water and rail transport range from 2 to 18% of the emission levels arising from road transport. Particle emissions show a more diverse pattern. Whilst fine particle emissions due to water and rail transport are considerably lower than road transport, rail transport with respect to coarse particles performs worse than road transport. Dominance analysis reveals the importance of infrastructure processes. For instance, the NMHC-emissions of infrastructure processes account for 40%, 30% and 50% of emissions for road, rail and barge transport, respectively. For the demand factor of infrastructure operation, a sensitivity analysis of the employed allocation factor was performed, revealing no sensitivity for gaseous emissions and particles. On the other hand, considerable changes in both emission levels and in the ranking of transport modes is observed for land occupation. Finally, we varied selected operation parameters for road transport, resulting in considerable reductions of CO2 and NOx emissions of Lip to 60%. In one extreme case (load factor: 100%), NOx emissions for vehicle operation of a lorry are lower than for inland water transport. Only as a result of the considerably higher NOx emissions occutting in infrastructure processes does road transport score worse than water transport, with the ranking remaining the same as for the generic data presented in ecoinvent 2000. Conclusions and Perspectives. The provided datasets allow for a preliminary screening of the importance of transport processes within a product life cycle. In the cases for which transport processes are identified as sensitive for the overall outcome of certain product life cycle or for transport specific comparisons, the modular structure and transparent documentation of demand factors allows for an easy and transparent integration of more case-specific data for selected transport components.},

In particular, we analysed the introduction of electric drive vehicles (EDV) and shifts between car segments. We performed the what-if-scenarios on the basis of the monitoring data for CO2 emissions from new passenger cars in the EU that was further reprocessed to achieve a break-down per vehicle segment, enriched with cost information and well-to-tank (WtT) emission data. Our calculations show that under the assumption that there are no significant segment shifts towards smaller vehicles, a minimum share of 11% of EDV would be needed to comply with a stricter CO2 target of 70g/km, as improvements on conventional cars cannot provide sufficient savings. Deploying the EDV allows a cost effective achievement of the regulatory TtW targets, but also leads to higher WtW emissions than the baseline under the assumption that the TtW targets are not overachieved. Public incentives would be necessary to increase the share of EDV in the portfolio. We calculated that the order of magnitude of these incentives would be in the range of scrappage schemes that have been recently witnessed in European countries. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

In the 2020s, electric car sales will reach the mass market with the total number of EVs on the road expected to increase by more than 30 times across Europe by 2030. This means that 97% of the electric cars that will be on the road in 2030 have not yet been sold (from 1.3 million EVs in the end of 2019 to 44 million in 20301). The arrival of the electric car has brought with it an array of lifecycle analyses estimating COâ emissions of electric cars including battery and charging, and comparing those to conventional cars.While many researchers have to rely on outdated data or evidence, some LCAs (or their interpretation) are deliberately misleading. A lot of these rely on outdated data to compare fast developing EVs with mature petrol or diesel technology that has little room for improvement. To bring clarity and transparency to this debate, T&E has produced a comprehensive and forward-looking comparison of electric, diesel and petrol engines in different car sizes for 2020 and 2030. The online tool , published alongside this paper, is based on the latest evidence that shows that an average EU electric car is already close to three times better than an equivalent conventional car today2. Crucially, electric cars will get considerably cleaner in the next few years as the EU economy decarbonises, with average EVs more than four times cleaner than conventional equivalents in 2030.},

Uncertain variation in energy demand is a challenge in the design of charging systems and on-board energy storages. To predict the energy demand, a computationally efficient model is required for real-time applications. We present a novel approach to predict energy demand variation with a wide range of uncertain factors. A factor identification is carried out to recognize the range of variation in the operating conditions. A computationally efficient surrogate model is generated based on a previously developed numerical simulation model. The surrogate model is shown to be 10 000 times faster than the numerical model. The surrogate model output corresponds with the numerical model with less than 1% error. The energy demand of the surrogate model varied from 0.43 to 2.30 kWh/km, which is realistic in comparison to previous studies. Successful sensitivity analysis of the surrogate model revealed the most crucial factors. Uncertainty in temperature, rolling resistance and payload contributed most to the variation in energy demand. Variation in these factors should be taken into account when predicting energy consumption and while planning schedules for a bus network.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Good background data are an important requirement in LCA. Practitioners generally make use of LCI databases for such data, and the ecoinvent database is the largest transparent unit-process LCI database worldwide. Since its first release in 2003, it has been continuously updated, and version 3 was published in 2013. The release of version 3 introduced several significant methodological and technological improvements, besides a large number of new and updated datasets. The aim was to expand the content of the database, set the foundation for a truly global database, support regionalized LCIA, offer multiple system models, allow for easier integration of data from different regions, and reduce maintenance efforts. This article describes the methodological developments. Methods: Modeling choices and raw data were separated in version 3, which enables the application of different sets of modeling choices, or system models, to the same raw data with little effort. This includes one system model for Consequential LCA. Flow properties were added to all exchanges in the database, giving more information on the inventory and allowing a fast calculation of mass and other balances. With version 3.1, the database is generally water-balanced, and water use and consumption can be determined. Consumption mixes called market datasets were consistently added to the database, and global background data was added, often as an extrapolation from regional data. Results and discussion: In combination with hundreds of new unit processes from regions outside Europe, these changes lead to an improved modeling of global supply chains, and a more realistic distribution of impacts in regionalized LCIA. The new mixes also facilitate further regionalization due to the availability of background data for all regions. Conclusions: With version 3, the ecoinvent database substantially expands the goals and scopes of LCA studies it can support. The new system models allow new, different studies to be performed. Global supply chains and market datasets significantly increase the relevance of the database outside of Europe, and regionalized LCA is supported by the data. Datasets are more transparent, include more information, and support, e.g., water balances. The developments also support easier collaboration with other database initiatives, as demonstrated by a first successful collaboration with a data project in Qu{\'{e}}bec. Version 3 has set the foundation for expanding ecoinvent from a mostly regional into a truly global database and offers many new insights beyond the thousands of new and updated datasets it also introduced.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Innovative fuel efficiency technologies as for example electrification and lightweight materials typically lead to a shift of emissions from the use phase to the production phase of a vehicle. Whether the efforts of applying sophisticated fuel saving technologies pay back in environmental terms over the products' lifetime depends directly on the lifetime mileage assumed. Currently, different âeducated guessâ values of industry associations and car manufacturers ranging from 150,000 to 300,000km are applied in automotive life cycle assessment (LCA). This study improves the database for LCA practitioners in the automotive industry by statistically determining empirical lifetime mileage values for different types of passenger cars. Methods: The analysis of different data sets of a sample of more than 800,000 vehicles in Germany is performed by using statistical techniques. Firstly, survival analysis is used to describe the typical lifetime of passenger cars by using the Weibull distribution. Secondly, regression analysis is used to describe the progression of mileage during the course of a car's life. The analysis differentiates eight different segments from urban small cars (A000) over midsized cars (A00, A0, A, B, C, D) to ultra luxury cars (E) as well as Otto and diesel engines. Results and discussions: The results show varying lifetimes and mileages of passenger cars depending on the engine type and vehicle segment. Many decisions on innovative automotive technologies are independent from the engine type. In this case, the recommendation of the authors is to differentiate between three different groups of segments (A00/A0, A/B, C) with mileages going from 170,000 over 200,000 to 230,000km. There might even be cases where the usage of a segment-specific value is not recommended. In such cases, the average value of the obtained results of 200,000km appears as feasible choice. Even though the primary data are from Germany only, it is assumed that the results obtained in this study can be used as a proxy estimate for the geographical area of Europe. Conclusions: The results of this paper can be used as default values for LCA practitioners performing automotive LCAs as they provide evidence-based values of passenger cars' lifetimes and mileages in a disaggregated way. The previously often used assumption of 150,000km based on educated guess represents an underestimated value and should be replaced by the data obtained in this study. Using the proposed lifetime mileage data improves the validity and representativeness of automotive LCAs in Europe.},

European manufacturers in particular must develop new vehicles and powertrains to comply with recent regulations and avoid fines for exceeding CO2 emissions. To answer the question regarding which powertrain concept provides the best option to lower the environmental impacts, it is necessary to evaluate all vehicle life-cycle phases. Different system boundaries and scopes of the current state of science complicate a holistic impact assessment. This paper presents a scaleable life-cycle inventory (LCI) for heavy-duty trucks and powertrains components. We combine primary and secondary data to compile a component-based inventory and apply it to internal combustion engine (ICE), hybrid and battery electric vehicles (BEV). The vehicles are configured with regard to their powertrain topology and the components are scaled according to weight models. The resulting material compositions are modeled with LCA software to obtain global warming potential and primary energy demand. Especially for BEV, decisions in product development strongly influence the vehicle's environmental impact. Our results show that the lithium-ion battery must be considered the most critical component for electrified powertrain concepts. Furthermore, the results highlight the importance of considering the vehicle production phase.},

	abstract = {The pursuit of energy density has driven electric vehicle (EV) batteries from using lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathodes in early days to ternary layered oxides increasingly rich in nickel; however, it is impossible to forgo the LFP battery due to its unsurpassed safety, as well as its low cost and cobalt-free nature. Here we demonstrate a thermally modulated LFP battery to offer an adequate cruise range per charge that is extendable by 10âmin recharge in all climates, essentially guaranteeing EVs that are free of range anxiety. Such a thermally modulated LFP battery designed to operate at a working temperature around 60âÂ°C in any ambient condition promises to be a well-rounded powertrain for mass-market EVs. Furthermore, we reveal that the limited working time at the high temperature presents an opportunity to use graphite of low surface areas, thereby prospectively prolonging the EV lifespan to greater than two million miles. Ternary layered oxides dominate the current automobile batteries but suffer from material scarcity and operational safety. Here the authors report that, when operating at around 60âÂ°C, a low-cost lithium iron phosphate-based battery exhibits ultra-safe, fast rechargeable and long-lasting properties.},

In the mid-twentieth century the air quality in Los Angeles was degraded to an extent comparable to the worst found in developing cities today; ozone exceeded 600 ppb and annual average particulate matter &lt;10 Î¼m reached ~150 mgâmâ3. Today's air quality is much better due to very effective emission controls; e.g., modern automobiles emit about 1% of the hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide emitted by vehicles of 50 years ago. An overview is given of the emission control efforts in Los Angeles and their impact on ambient concentrations of primary and secondary pollutants; the costs and health benefits of these controls are briefly summarized. Today's developing cities have new challenges that are discussed: the effects of regional pollution transport are much greater in countries with very high population densities; often very large current populations must be supplied with goods and services even while economic development and air quality concerns are addressed; and many of currently developing cities are located in or close to the tropics where photochemical processing of pollution is expected to be more rapid than at higher latitudes. The air quality issues of Beijing are briefly compared and contrasted with those of Los Angeles, and the opportunities for co-benefits for climate and air quality improvement are pointed out.},

In regards to road traffic, it includes vehicle noise emission models implicitly referring to internal combustion vehicles. The development of electrically driven vehicles calls for the future consideration of these vehicles in prediction models. On the basis of experimental data, the study reported in this paper proposes a noise emission model for extending CNOSSOS-EU to light electric vehicles. Correction terms to be applied to the propulsion noise component are determined. Investigations on a sample of tyres with good rolling resistance performance, which is a main tyre selection criterion on these vehicles, indicated that no correction is required for the rolling noise component. Differences between the noise emission from conventional vehicles and electric vehicles are discussed for several road surfaces. Owing to the limited vehicle sample as well as transitional statements, this new model for electric vehicles running at constant speed over 20Â km/h should be considered as a first step towards the definition of this vehicle technology in CNOSSOS-EU.},

	abstract = {Prospective Life Cycle Assessment (pLCA) is useful to evaluate the environmental performance of current and emerging technologies in the future. Yet, as energy systems and industries are rapidly shifting towards cleaner means of production, pLCA requires an inventory database that encapsulates the expected changes in technologies and the environment at a given point in time, following specific socio-techno-economic pathways. To this end, this study introduces premise, a tool to streamline the generation of prospective inventory databases for pLCA by integrating scenarios generated by Integrated Assessment Models (IAM). More precisely, premise applies a number of transformations on energy-intensive activities found in the inventory database ecoinvent according to projections provided by the IAM. Unsurprisingly, the study shows that, within a given socio-economic narrative, the climate change mitigation target chosen affects the performance of nearly all activities in the database. This is illustrated by focusing on the effects observed on a few activities, such as systems for direct air capture of CO2, lithium-ion batteries, electricity and clinker production as well as freight transport by road, in relation to the applied sector-based transformation and the chosen climate change mitigation target. This work also discusses the limitations and challenges faced when coupling IAM and LCA databases and what improvements are to be brought in to further facilitate the development of pLCA.},

	abstract = {This study presents an integrated techno-environmental assessment of hydrogen production from natural gas and biomethane, combined with CO2 capture and storage (CCS). We have included steam methane reforming (SMR) and autothermal reforming (ATR) for syngas production. CO2 is captured from the syngas with a novel vacuum pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) process, that combines hydrogen purification and CO2 separation in one cycle. As comparison, we have included cases with conventional amine-based technology. We have extended standard attributional Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) following ISO standards with a detailed carbon balance of the biogas production process (via digestion) and its by-products. The results show that the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) performance of the VPSA and amine-based CO2 capture technologies is very similar as a result of comparable energy consumption. The configuration with the highest plant-wide CO2 capture rate (almost 100% of produced CO2 captured) is autothermal reforming with a two-stage water-gas shift and VPSA CO2 capture â because the latter has an inherently high CO2 capture rate of 98% or more for the investigated syngas. Depending on the configuration, the addition of CCS to natural gas reforming-based hydrogen production reduces its life-cycle Global Warming Potential by 45â85 percent, while the other environmental life-cycle impacts slightly increase. This brings natural gas-based hydrogen on par with renewable electricity-based hydrogen regarding impacts on climate change. When biomethane is used instead of natural gas, our study shows potential for net negative greenhouse gas emissions, i.e. the net removal of CO2 over the life cycle of biowaste-based hydrogen production. In the special case where the biogas digestate is used as agricultural fertiliser, and where a substantial amount of the carbon in the digestate remains in the soil, the biowaste-based hydrogen reaches net-negative life cycle greenhouse gas emissions even without the application of CCS. Addition of CCS to biomethane-based hydrogen production leads to net-negative emissions in all investigated cases.},

	abstract = {Electricity generation from renewable sources is increasing and will grow further in the future. Since some of this renewable electricity is intermittent and cannot always be consumed when it is generated, options for matching energy demand and supply are needed. Besides electricity storage, coupling the electricity and gas sectors by converting renewable electricity to hydrogen through water electrolysis can be considered a promising option. With CO2 obtained from various sources, hydrogen can further be reacted to produce methane to facilitate large scale gas storage. Among âPower-to-methaneâ systems, there are a few pathways designed to utilize the CO2 from biogas. However, studies that quantify life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of such systems are limited, yet are an essential basis when comparing such systems with other alternatives regarding decarbonisation of the energy system. This study therefore focuses on addressing this research gap by providing transparent life cycle inventories and analyses and investigating the life cycle GHG emissions of biogas upgrading, methanation with CO2 from biogas upgrading, and direct biogas methanation. These systems are compared with other fuels in the mobility sector. The analysis also provides an estimate of the potential of such systems to reduce GHG emissions on a country level by considering the availability of biomass and the required amount of renewable electricity. In addition, the results are compared with those of power-to-methane pathways using other CO2 sources and literature values. Our analysis shows that using biomethane as vehicle fuel produced by the systems investigated could provide GHG emission reductions of 27â62% compared to conventional natural gas passenger vehicles or 41â70% compared to petrol vehicles. Although the limited resources of suitable biomass will be a constraint to the widespread deployment of power-to-methane systems using biogenic carbon, the available potential should be used, since it represents an attractive option for reduction of GHG emissions in a future energy system with large amounts of intermittent renewable power generation.},

	abstract = {The production of battery materials has been identified as the main contributor to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of lithium-ion batteries for automotive applications. Graphite manufacturing is characterized by energy intense production processes (including extraction), mainly being operated in China with low energy prices and a relatively high GHG emission intensity of electricity generation. Industrial scale primary data related to the production of battery materials lacks transparency and remains scarce in general. In particular, life cycle inventory datasets related to the extraction, refining and coating of graphite as anode material for lithium-ion batteries are incomplete, out of date and hardly representative for today's battery applications. Nevertheless, primary life cycle inventory data of battery materials like graphite, produced on an industrial scale are crucial for a robust evaluation of batteries for electric vehicles, material sourcing and development of robust decarbonization strategies. This paper addresses this issue by first providing a comprehensive overview of the existing graphite datasets and their original sources, and outlining the reasons for wide variations of reported environmental impact results. Furthermore, this paper aims at closing existing data gaps by providing transparent primary data from a Chinese graphite producer from 2019 and assessing the environmental impacts (cradle-to-gate) in form of a life cycle assessment (LCA) for a vertically integrated graphite production. The life cycle inventory covers material, water, energy flows and direct emissions associated with the production of natural graphite anode material for an automotive battery application and associated transport activities along the supply chain. The results of the LCA show that the production of 1000 kg of natural graphite anode material has a global warming potential (GWP) of approximately 9616 kg CO2eq. The subsequent uncertainty analysis in the form of a Monte-Carlo-Analysis with 10000 runs reveals that the 95% confidence interval is in the range between 9297 and 9940 kg CO2eq. This value is more than four times higher than the reported GWP of battery-grade graphite in the ecoinvent database version 3.7.1.},

	abstract = {In moving towards a more sustainable society, hydrogen fueled polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell technology is seen as a great opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of the transport sector. However, decision makers have the challenge of understanding the real environmental consequences of producing fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) compared to alternative green cars, such as battery electric vehicles (BEVs). and more conventional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). In this work, we presented a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA) of a FCV focused on its manufacturing phase and compared with the production of a BEV and an ICEV. For the manufacturing phase, the FCV inventories started from the catalyst layer to the glider, including the hydrogen tank. A sensitivity analysis on some of the key components of the fuel cell stack and the FC system (such as balance-of-plant and hydrogen tank) was carried out to account for different assumptions on materials and inventory models. The production process of the fuel cell vehicle showed a higher environmental impact compared to the production of the other two vehicles power sources. This is mainly due to the hydrogen tank and the fuel cell stack. However, by combining the results of the sensitivity analysis for each component - a best-case scenario showed that there is the potential for a 25% reduction in the climate change impact category for the FCV compared to a baseline FCV scenario. Reducing the environmental impact associated with the manufacture of fuel cell vehicles represents an important challenge. The entire life cycle has also been considered and the manufacturing, use and disposal of FCV, electric vehicle and conventional diesel vehicle were compared. Overall, the ICEV showed the highest GWP and this was mainly due to the use phase and the fossil carbon emissions associated to the use of diesel.},
